# TinyApp

TinyApp is a full stack web application that allows users to shorten long URLs (similar to bit.ly). TinyApp is built with Node and Express.

## Current State:

This version of TinyApp displays two stored urls and allows you to search for their long url via their id.

You can now log in and log out!
